SETUP:
======

This is a single page website. By default there are only three slides. You can add or remove slides as you want. For more info on adding or removing slides see here: [http://flowplayer.org/tools/scrollable/index.html#plugins][8]

Change the info in each of the divs following the `<!--Example Section-->` comments.

Change the name inside the h1 tag in the `<!--Home Section-->` and replace the content div text.

Change the links to your social media profiles in the `<!--Social Network Section-->` Add or remove networks as needed. You can see the complete list of icons in the img folder.

The `<!--Contact Section-->` includes a form for you to hook up. Just set the action to whatever you want. I would use a simple PHP email script.

Questions:
==========
For questions email [contact@travisberry.com][9]

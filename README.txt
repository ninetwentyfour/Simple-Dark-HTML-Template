SETUP:

This is a single page website. By default there are only three slides. You can add or remove slides as you want. For more info on adding or removing slides see here: http://flowplayer.org/tools/scrollable/index.html#plugins

Change the info in each of the divs following the <!--Example Section--> comments.

Change the name inside the h1 tag in the <!--Home Section--> and replace the content div text.

Change the links to your social media profiles in the <!--Social Network Section--> Add or remove networks as needed. You can see the complete list of icons in the img folder.

The <!--Contact Section--> includes a form for you to hook up. Just set the action to whatever you want. I would use a simple PHP email script.
